# Election Audit

## Overview of the Election Audit
The election audit was conducted to find the results for the different groupings of votes. The two groupings tied to a vote are the county that the vote was casted in and the candidate for the vote. We used python script to count the total vote, vote for each county, vote for each candidate, and the percent of vote each county and candidate had out of the total vote. 

## Audit Results
* There were 369,711 total votes
* The counties in order of votes: 
  *  Arapahoe 24,801 votes, 6.7% of all votes
  *  Jefferson 38,855 votes, 10.5% of all votes
  *  Denver 306,055 votes, 83.8% of all votes
* Denver had the most votes of all the counties
* The candidates in order of votes:
  * Raymond Anthony Doane 11,606 votes, 3.1% of all votes
  * Charles Casper Stockham 85,213 votes, 23% of all votes
  * Diana Debette 272,892 votes, 73.8% of all votes
* Diana Debette was the candidate with the most votes with 272,892 votes and 73.8% of all the votes

## Audit Summary
The script will need to change as the variables/column headers change. That means that if there are more than one candidate then the candidate script for this election will need to be replicated and applied to the additional columns. Another variable that might be helpful would be a date variable that would allow an analyst to understand voter turnout in the specific counties over time.
